Perplexity  general meaning is = the state of being confused, puzzled, or uncertain.

Low perplexity = model is less confused = better predictions.

High perplexity = model is more confused = worse predictions

[basic understanding ] 

>1) multiplying by less then zero always shrinks the value 

i.e 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 
0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561 (closer , close to zero)

2) llm predict next word probability 

for sentence: a red fox 
p(a red fox) = P(“a”) * P(“red” | “a”) * P(“fox” | “a red”) * P(“.” | “a red fox”)

(p(a) means , probabilit of a  ) 

p('red' | 'a ') means , proability of red given 'a' 


issuse with this 

we know probabiliy is always between (0,1).
and assume  sentence has only two  word 'my name is ' and assume 
each  word probabilty are equal i.e 0.5 

then 
p(my name  ) = 0.5 * 0.5  
            = 0.25 \


and for 3 word sentence  , also assume each probability are equal then 
p(my name is ) = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 
            = 0.125 

p(3 words) less than   p(2 word) 

which means naturally , longer sentences has less probability 


solution : 
To solve this we use  
(geomertic mean) 
Geometric Mean= 
n
  
x 
1
​
 ×x 
2
​
 ×⋯×x 
n
​

so that 
for two words , n = 2 , so 
root 2 (0.5 * 05) = o,5 probability 

and 
for three words 

root 3 (0.5 * o.5 * o.5) = 0.5 

this is normalization 



 

​


but if sentence has two word 'a fox' then p('fox' |'a' ) is less then 1 



so on , longer sentence naturally has 
a language model is trained to anticipate the next word in a sentence: “A red fox.” The anticipated word probabilities for a competent LLM could be as follows:
P(“a red fox.”) = P(“a”) * P(“red” | “a”) * P(“fox” | “a red”) *
P(“.” | “a red fox”)
