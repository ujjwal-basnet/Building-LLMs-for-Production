### 1.âœ…  ðŸ“„ Research Paper: [Chinchilla: An Empirical Model of Compute-Optimal Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556)

- **Finding:** For a model with **X parameters**, the **optimal training** involves approximately **X Ã— 20 tokens**.
- **Example:** A model with **100 billion parameters** should ideally be trained on about **2 trillion tokens**.
-  This insight shifts focus from just scaling model size â†’ to **balancing model size and training data** for optimal performance.
